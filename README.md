Robotics [1.12.2]
=================

The purpose of Robotics is to give a simple implementation of small robots for minor tasks.

Units
-----

### Concentration

I would like to use molarity instead of parts-per notation, but that can get difficult for those who aren't well versed in Chemistry.  It'll probably be easier for the average player to use parts-per notation since it converts to a direct percentage pretty easily when searching for resource concentrations.

### Power

I'm going to start out with basic [Joules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule) and we can move on from there, as it can be easily converted to anything else.

Basic Entities
--------------

- AC Generator
- Battery Charger
- Battery Bay
- Granite Dust
- Hectorite Clay
- Lithium Dust
- Lithium Ingot
- Lithium Ion Battery
- Methane (Fuel)
- Sentient Robot
- USB-C Cable

Recipes
-------

Granite -> Pulverize -> Granite Dust -> Centrifuge -> Lithium Dust

Lithium Dust -> Smelt -> Lithium Ingot
Lithium Dust -> Crucible -> Liquefied Lithium
