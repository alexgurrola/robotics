MBE21_TILEENTITYSPECIALRENDERER

This example shows how to use a TileEntitySpecialRenderer.  It uses a simple block and a TileEntity to store the animation
  parameters.

It will show you
1) how to create a TESR and bind it to a TileEntity
2) how to correctly translate so that your TileEntity renders in the correct place
3) how to save and restore the rendering settings so that subsequent renders by vanilla aren't affected
4) how to set the typical settings for rendering

The pieces you need to understand are located in:
Startup
TileEntityMBE21
TileEntitySpecialRendererMBE21

resources\assets\robotics\lang\en_US.lang - for the displayed name of the block
resources\assets\robotics\blockstates\mbe21_tesr_block.json - for the blockstate definition
resources\assets\robotics\models\item\mbe21_tesr_block.json - the model for rendering the item
resources\assets\robotics\textures\items\mbe21_tesr_item_icon.png - item icon
resources\assets\robotics\entity\items\mbe21_tesr_gem.png - texture used for the gem

The block will appear in the Blocks tab in the creative inventory.

Common errors:
"Missing Model", "Missing texture", etc:
These are caused when you have specified a filename or path which is not correct, typically:
1) you've misspelled it
2) the upper/lower case doesn't match
3) you've forgotten the resource domain, eg "blockmodel" instead of "robotics:blockmodel"
4) the folder structure of your assets folders is incorrect
5) If using IntelliJ 14 - the assets isn't be copied to the right place, you need to apply a fix to your build.gradle,
  see here http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/index.php/topic,21354.0.html

Rendering doesn't look right- this is a relatively complex subject and can be difficult to troubleshoot.  Generally:
The object is in the wrong spot, or doesn't rotate how you expect
a) your translation is wrong
b) your order of transformations (rotations, translations, scaling etc) is wrong
See Chapter 3 OpenGL red book http://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter03.html

If the object is too light or too dark-
a) one or more of the openGL settings is incorrect (especially - GL_LIGHTING)
b) the multitexturing "brightness" (blocklight/skylight) is not right (see OpenGlHelper.setLightmapTextureCoords)
c) your GlStateManager.color(red, green, blue); is wrong

You can't see parts of your object from one side
a) If you want your faces to be visible on both sides, you need to disable GL_CULL_FACE.
b) If your face should be one-sided, but is facing the wrong way, you need to reverse the order of the points for that face
  for example, you have specified points in the order A, B, C, D ---> change the order to D, C, B, A
