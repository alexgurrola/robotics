 * HectoriteClay is a ordinary solid cube with the six faces numbered from 0 - 5.
 * For background information on blocks see here http://greyminecraftcoder.blogspot.com.au/2014/12/blocks-18.html
 * <p>
 * For a couple of the methods below the Forge guys have marked it as deprecated.  But you still need to override those
 * "deprecated" block methods.  What they mean is "when you want to find out if a block is (eg) isOpaqueCube(),
 * don't call block.isOpaqueCube(), call iBlockState.isOpaqueCube() instead".
 * If that doesn't make sense to you yet, don't worry.  Just ignore the "deprecated method" warning.
