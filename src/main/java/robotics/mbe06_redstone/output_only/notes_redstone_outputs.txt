The two blocks in this package are redstone power sources; they provide power to other blocks.

The three key methods they use are
  public boolean canProvidePower()
  public int getWeakPower(IBlockAccess worldIn, BlockPos pos, IBlockState state, EnumFacing side)
  public int getStrongPower(IBlockAccess worldIn, BlockPos pos, IBlockState state, EnumFacing side)
