BlockRedstoneColouredLamp is an example of a power consumer - similar to the vanilla redstone lamp.
It illustrates how to read the power inputs from adjacent blocks.
It also shows how to use a TileEntity to store power information for transmitting to the client side for rendering
(An alternative method is to use metadata instead, if there are any available bits left).
